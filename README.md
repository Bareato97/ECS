# ECS
 An attempt at a C++ Entity Component System
This is an ECS based on a design by Austrin Morlan (https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/), to act as a base for a more detailed system used
as part of a game engine.
This ECS supports entities, components and systems, with components just being POD while logic is handled by systems

This is currently designed with a project in mind, and to be used as an opportunity to learn.

Some features are yet to be implemented like serialisation, or propery memory allocation. As this current version is more a proof of concept

Header only file that can be included in an include directory.
